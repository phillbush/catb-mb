                                 CatB:
                     Troff -mb Unauthorized Edition

After creating the -mb macro package for troff, I wanted to test it with
a real book.  I also wanted to read «The Cathedral and The Bazaar».  So,
since the Copyright permits, I am doing both at the same time.

The document is distributed with the mb.tmac macro package, which I used
to format the document using troff.

I used Heirloom Doctools to format the book.
